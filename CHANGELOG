Muri Changelog
===================================

Version 1.1.5
  * Minor update, changed facebook "media_api_id" to only return a string representation, not a hash
    - Facebook provides "media_api_ids" which is a hash including pid, uid, and fql_id (the regular "media_api_id")
    
EXPERIMENTAL
  * Added Fetching capabilities to muri
    - API fetching enabled from muri.yaml file if using rails (call `murify` in a manner similar to capistrano's `capify`), or from setting Muri::Options object
    - 3 ways to fetch
      1. Can call fetch! directly on a muri parsed object
      2. Can call new_muri_object = Muri.fetch(parsed_muri_object)
      3. Can call muri_object = Muri.parse_and_fetch('www.blahblah.com')
    (Calling fetch! on a muri object returns a boolean indicating if the API could fetch information)
    - When properly fetched, vimeo has a media_thumbnail_large for HQ thumbnail

Version 1.1.3
  * Changed "FLICKR_PHOTO" to "FLICKR_MEDIA" (since it can parse videos)
    - "flickr_photo?" is replaced by "flickr_media?" now
  * Facebook parser overhaul thanks to their new 'Graph API'
    - media_api_id is no longer the true facebook database API id for photos, though it is now for videos
    - Facebook parser accepts video URL's, but albums temporarily disabled
  * Removed deprecated "is_" methods
  * Changed service names all lowercase letters (eg. "Vimeo" to "vimeo").
    - Should not have any major impact on usage, mostly an internal change.
  * URL parse now only escapes spaces, not all characters (allows # to create URI fragment)
