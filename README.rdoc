= Media URI Parser - MURI

A simple to use media URI Parser. Pass a URI in, get helpful information out.

MURI Currently supports:
* Youtube
* Vimeo
* Flickr
* Imageshack
* Photobucket

== Installation & basic usage

Install muri as a ruby gem (you might need to run this command as root by prepending +sudo+ to it):

  $ gem install muri

Using muri is just as easy!

  a = Muri.parse('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blahblahblah&feature=rec-LGOUT-exp_fresh+div-1r-1-HM')
  a.service         # 'Youtube'
  a.media_id        # 'blahblahblah'
  a.media_url       # 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blahblahblah' (flickr media_url's provide the flic.kr/p/ID short url)
  a.original_url    # 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blahblahblah&feature=rec-LGOUT-exp_fresh+div-1r-1-HM'
  a.uri             # Parsed URI object for 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blahblahblah&feature=rec-LGOUT-exp_fresh+div-1r-1-HM'

Due to variations in information which can be gathered from a uri, some services provide more information than others. For example:
  * A direct media url for Youtube, Photobucket, and Flickr (http://imgBLAH.imageshack.us/imgBLAH/NUMBER/IMAGENAME format)
    a.url             # 'http://www.youtube.com/v/blahblahblah'
  
  * Media creator name for Flickr URI's (for uri's in the http://www.flickr.com/photos/USER/PHOTO-ID/ format)
    a.media_creator   # 'bananastalktome'
  
  * Media size and content type for Flickr URI's (for uri's in the http://farm3.static.flickr.com/NUMBERS/MORE-NUMBERS_LETTERS-AND-NUMBERS_SIZE-INDICATOR.jpg
    a.media_size      # 'small'
    a.content_type    # 'jpg' (Content Type also for Imageshack and Photobucket)
    
  * Thumbnails URL for Youtube and Photobucket
    a.media_thumbnail
    
    
  * Some additional information may be provided, which can be determined by looking through each filters code.
  

If an attribute is not present, muri returns +nil+.

I plan on including more services _and_ more parse information with updates. That being said, MURI is currently not production quality. Please use with caution and in development only. Thank you.
