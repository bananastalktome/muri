h2. Media URI Parser - MURI

A simple to use media URI Parser. Pass a URI in, get helpful information out.

MURI Currently supports:
* Youtube
** "API documentation":http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol_audience.html
* Vimeo (single videos and albums)
** "API documentation":http://vimeo.com/api/docs/simple-api
* Flickr (single images and sets)
** "API documentation":http://www.flickr.com/services/api/
* Imageshack
* Photobucket
** "API documentation":http://photobucket.com/developer/documentation
* Facebook
** "API documentation":http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/API

h3. Installation & basic usage

Install muri as a ruby gem (you might need to run this command as root by prepending @sudo@ to it):
<pre>
<code>
  $ gem install muri
</code>
</pre>
Using muri is just as easy!

<pre>
<code>
  a = Muri.parse('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blahblahblah&feature=rec-LGOUT-exp_fresh+div-1r-1-HM')
  a.service         # 'Youtube'
  a.media_id        # 'blahblahblah'
  a.original_url    # 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blahblahblah&feature=rec-LGOUT-exp_fresh+div-1r-1-HM'
  a.uri             # URI object for 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blahblahblah&feature=rec-LGOUT-exp_fresh+div-1r-1-HM'
</code>
</pre>

*Due to variations in information which can be gathered from a uri, some services provide more information than others. For example:*

* All but Imageshack have a @media_api_id@, which is the ID which can be used in API calls to the related services. Typically the same as @media_id@.

<pre>
<code>  
  a.media_api_id     # 'blahblahblah'
</code>
</pre>

*NOTE: Facebook photos return a hash for @media_api_id@, keyed with @pid@ (the ID for the photo) and @user_id@ (the ID for the user)*

* Services with a @media_api_id@ also have a @media_api_type@, which indicates what sort of API call should be made (be it photo, video, set, album, media)

* A direct media url for Youtube, Photobucket, and Imageshack (@img#{num}.imageshack.us/img#{num}/#{NUMBER}/#{IMAGENAME}@ format)

<pre>
<code>
  a.media_url         # 'http://www.youtube.com/v/blahblahblah'
</code>
</pre>

* A media landing website url for Youtube, Photobucket, Imageshack, Vimeo, and Flickr (flickr media_url's provide the @flic.kr/p/#{ID}@ short url)

<pre>
<code>
  a.website           # 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blahblahblah' 
</code>
</pre>

* Content type for Imageshack, Photobucket and Flickr URI's (flickr in the @farm#{num}.static.flickr.com/@ format)

<pre>
<code>
  a.content_type      # 'jpg' (Content Type also for Imageshack and Photobucket)
</code>
</pre>

* Thumbnails URL for Youtube Photobucket, and Flickr (flickr in the #farm#{num}.static.flickr.com/# format)

<pre>
<code>
  a.media_thumbnail   # 'http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4CYDFoEz8rg/default.jpg'
</code>
</pre>

*Some additional information may be provided, which can be determined by looking through each filters code.*


If an attribute is not present, muri returns @nil@.

I plan on including more services _and_ more parse information with updates. That being said, MURI is currently not production quality. Please use with caution and in development only. Thank you.
